# ionic-audio
This is the plugin version for Ionic v1 made by [Arielfaur](https://github.com/arielfaur/ionic-audio). I am re-uploading it for the projects that are still using Ionic V1. 

If you are looking for the Ionic v3 version head [here](https://github.com/arielfaur/ionic-audio).
# Install dependencies
